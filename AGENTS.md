this is a repo that documents the process of setting up a home lab environment.
It includes guides, configurations, and best practices for building and
maintaining a home lab for various purposes such as learning, testing, and
development.

this home lab setup is not for this machine but for a debian linux enviroment that i will be setting up

it also includes setup scripts, configuration files, and documentation for different components of the home lab.

all homelab plans are documented in a external directory at `~/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/jojo-vault/journal/homelab` as mardown files
